To address this, we've developed an AI-powered system that processes and analyzes a collection of publicly available support documents, making the information within them easier to access and understand.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Our work demonstrates two key AI capabilities: answering complex questions and summarizing lengthy documents.\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch2 id=\"answering-questions-with-rag\">Answering Questions with RAG\u003C/h2>\n\u003Cp>We have implemented a technique called Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) to build a question-answering system. After downloading and processing a corpus of documents, our system can answer questions by first searching these documents for the most relevant information. It then uses that specific context to generate a precise and trustworthy answer, ensuring the information is grounded in the source material.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cfigure class=\"my-2 space-y-2\">\u003Cimg src=\"https://github.com/NERC-Digital-Solutions-Hub/dsh-content/raw/refs/heads/dev/pages/research/articles/ai-document-insights/architecture-extract-descriptions.svg\" alt=\"Architecture diagram for the RAG pipeline\" class=\"w-full\" loading=\"lazy\">\u003Cfigcaption class=\"text-sm text-muted-foreground\">Architecture diagram for the RAG pipeline\u003C/figcaption>\u003C/figure>\n\u003Ch2 id=\"summarizing-a-mountain-of-documents\">Summarizing a Mountain of Documents\u003C/h2>\n\u003Cp>To tackle long and complex documents, we built a summarization tool that uses AI to produce clear and concise summaries. The system has been designed to effectively read through lengthy material and extract the key points, generating a summary that captures the main ideas of the original document.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cfigure class=\"my-2 space-y-2\">\u003Cimg src=\"https://github.com/NERC-Digital-Solutions-Hub/dsh-content/raw/refs/heads/dev/pages/research/articles/ai-document-insights/architecture-summarise.svg\" alt=\"Architecture diagram for the summarization process\" class=\"w-full\" loading=\"lazy\">\u003Cfigcaption class=\"text-sm text-muted-foreground\">Architecture diagram for the summarization process\u003C/figcaption>\u003C/figure>\n\u003Cp>Through this project, we have shown how AI can make a large body of public knowledge more accessible and easier to understand for everyone.\u003C/p>",{}],"uses":{"params":["title"]}}]}
