            "description": "This dataset contains two indices representing flood social vulnerability and risk produced by Sayers and Partners LLP (Sayers et al., 2017). The Neighbourhood Flood Vulnerability Index (NFVI) provides insight into the social vulnerability of a neighbourhood should a flood occur. The NFVI combines five characteristics of vulnerability: (1) Susceptibility - describing the predisposition of an individual to experience a loss of well-being when exposed to a flood, e.g. age or ill-health; (2) Ability to prepare - reflecting the actions taken by an individual during normal conditions (i.e. in the absence of a forecast or actual flood) that are likely to reduce the harm they suffer when a future flood occurs, e.g. income or local knowledge. (3) Ability to respond – reflecting the underlying reasons why some individuals act more effectively in the run up to and during a flood, e.g. physical mobility. (4) Ability to recover – reflecting the degree to which an individual can aid their own recovery is influenced by several factors, e.g. income or capacity to use information (5) Community support – recognising how the availability and quality of services provided by health and emergency services as well as broader care and social services influence the severity of harm caused by a flood. The characteristics layers are made up of indicators like Age and Health (which are mapped separately) and a series of supporting variables. Map categories are given according to scores in the index with Acute indicating areas where social vulnerability is highest in a UK context: Acute, Very High, Relatively High; Average (UK mean); Relatively Low, Very Low and Slight. The level of social flood risk (SFRI) at a neighbourhood scale is a measure of geographic flood disadvantage (i.e. where social vulnerability and exposure to flooding coincide). The Social Flood Risk Index (SFRI) is a relative index and has no defined units. The greater the value for a neighbourhood, the higher the level of social flood risk.High levels of risk occur where high numbers of people live in the floodplain in a neighbourhood with high social vulnerability. High negative values are a result of high numbers of people living in the floodplain in a neighbourhood with low social vulnerability. Neighbourhoods where no-one lives in the floodplain have a value of zero. Social flood risk maps are provided for two flood themes: pluvial (surface water) flooding coastal and fluvial flooding combined Social flood risk maps cover three different scenarios: Present day; 2050s 2 degrees rise in Global Mean Temperature (GMT) (from the 1961-90 baseline as used in the latest UK climate change projections (UKCP09); 2050s 4 degrees rise in GMT assuming a continuation in current levels of adaptation and high population growth. Social flood risk is given as two different measures for each neighbourhood: Neighbourhood scale - a 'group' measure which incorporates the chance of flooding occurring in the floodplain (accounting for defences), the number of people living within the floodplain and the overall social vulnerability of the neighbourhood. High positive scores identify neighbourhoods where large numbers of the most vulnerable people are exposed to flooding. Individual scale - an 'average' measure which incorporates the chance of flooding occurring in the floodplain (accounting for defences) and the overall social vulnerability of the neighbourhood. The measure generates a 'per person' risk estimate. It helps to identify neighbourhoods where the vulnerability of those exposed is high (even when in reality only a few people may be exposed). It is calculated by dividing the SFRI group measure by the floodplain population.",

            "description": "This dataset contains two indices representing flood social vulnerability and risk produced by Sayers and Partners LLP (Sayers et al., 2017). The Neighbourhood Flood Vulnerability Index (NFVI) provides insight into the social vulnerability of a neighbourhood should a flood occur. The NFVI combines five characteristics of vulnerability: (1) Susceptibility - describing the predisposition of an individual to experience a loss of well-being when exposed to a flood, e.g. age or ill-health; (2) Ability to prepare - reflecting the actions taken by an individual during normal conditions (i.e. in the absence of a forecast or actual flood) that are likely to reduce the harm they suffer when a future flood occurs, e.g. income or local knowledge. (3) Ability to respond – reflecting the underlying reasons why some individuals act more effectively in the run up to and during a flood, e.g. physical mobility. (4) Ability to recover – reflecting the degree to which an individual can aid their own recovery is influenced by several factors, e.g. income or capacity to use information (5) Community support – recognising how the availability and quality of services provided by health and emergency services as well as broader care and social services influence the severity of harm caused by a flood. The characteristics layers are made up of indicators like Age and Health (which are mapped separately) and a series of supporting variables. Map categories are given according to scores in the index with Acute indicating areas where social vulnerability is highest in a UK context: Acute, Very High, Relatively High; Average (UK mean); Relatively Low, Very Low and Slight. The level of social flood risk (SFRI) at a neighbourhood scale is a measure of geographic flood disadvantage (i.e. where social vulnerability and exposure to flooding coincide). The Social Flood Risk Index (SFRI) is a relative index and has no defined units. The greater the value for a neighbourhood, the higher the level of social flood risk.High levels of risk occur where high numbers of people live in the floodplain in a neighbourhood with high social vulnerability. High negative values are a result of high numbers of people living in the floodplain in a neighbourhood with low social vulnerability. Neighbourhoods where no-one lives in the floodplain have a value of zero. Social flood risk maps are provided for two flood themes: pluvial (surface water) flooding coastal and fluvial flooding combined Social flood risk maps cover three different scenarios: Present day; 2050s 2 degrees rise in Global Mean Temperature (GMT) (from the 1961-90 baseline as used in the latest UK climate change projections (UKCP09); 2050s 4 degrees rise in GMT assuming a continuation in current levels of adaptation and high population growth. Social flood risk is given as two different measures for each neighbourhood: Neighbourhood scale - a 'group' measure which incorporates the chance of flooding occurring in the floodplain (accounting for defences), the number of people living within the floodplain and the overall social vulnerability of the neighbourhood. High positive scores identify neighbourhoods where large numbers of the most vulnerable people are exposed to flooding. Individual scale - an 'average' measure which incorporates the chance of flooding occurring in the floodplain (accounting for defences) and the overall social vulnerability of the neighbourhood. The measure generates a 'per person' risk estimate. It helps to identify neighbourhoods where the vulnerability of those exposed is high (even when in reality only a few people may be exposed). It is calculated by dividing the SFRI group measure by the floodplain population.",

            "description": "This data set contains UK-wide maps of ten different among-model ensemble approaches for two services: above ground Carbon stock and water supply. The data for Carbon comes as fourteen TIF maps for above ground carbon storage at a 1-km2 resolution with associated world files: ten approaches, with a double option for two of those, together with maps of variation among models and among ensembles. For water, the data comes as one shapefile with polygons per watershed, each polygon containing these fourteen estimates. For all maps, 600dpi jpg depictions are added to the supporting information. Directory location independent layer files are included to aid scaling and providing the colour palettes. Ensemble output maps were calculated with different approaches following the supporting documentation and associated publication. Uncertainty estimates for these services are included as variation among contributing model outputs and among the employed ensemble approaches. The work was completed under the ‘EnsemblES - Using ensemble techniques to capture the accuracy and sensitivity of ecosystem service models’ project (NE/T00391X/1) funded by the UKRI Landscape Decisions programme.

            "description": "This dataset contains two indices representing flood social vulnerability and risk produced by Sayers and Partners LLP (Sayers et al., 2017). The Neighbourhood Flood Vulnerability Index (NFVI) provides insight into the social vulnerability of a neighbourhood should a flood occur. The NFVI combines five characteristics of vulnerability: (1) Susceptibility - describing the predisposition of an individual to experience a loss of well-being when exposed to a flood, e.g. age or ill-health; (2) Ability to prepare - reflecting the actions taken by an individual during normal conditions (i.e. in the absence of a forecast or actual flood) that are likely to reduce the harm they suffer when a future flood occurs, e.g. income or local knowledge. (3) Ability to respond – reflecting the underlying reasons why some individuals act more effectively in the run up to and during a flood, e.g. physical mobility. (4) Ability to recover – reflecting the degree to which an individual can aid their own recovery is influenced by several factors, e.g. income or capacity to use information (5) Community support – recognising how the availability and quality of services provided by health and emergency services as well as broader care and social services influence the severity of harm caused by a flood. The characteristics layers are made up of indicators like Age and Health (which are mapped separately) and a series of supporting variables. Map categories are given according to scores in the index with Acute indicating areas where social vulnerability is highest in a UK context: Acute, Very High, Relatively High; Average (UK mean); Relatively Low, Very Low and Slight. The level of social flood risk (SFRI) at a neighbourhood scale is a measure of geographic flood disadvantage (i.e. where social vulnerability and exposure to flooding coincide). The Social Flood Risk Index (SFRI) is a relative index and has no defined units. The greater the value for a neighbourhood, the higher the level of social flood risk.High levels of risk occur where high numbers of people live in the floodplain in a neighbourhood with high social vulnerability. High negative values are a result of high numbers of people living in the floodplain in a neighbourhood with low social vulnerability. Neighbourhoods where no-one lives in the floodplain have a value of zero. Social flood risk maps are provided for two flood themes: pluvial (surface water) flooding coastal and fluvial flooding combined Social flood risk maps cover three different scenarios: Present day; 2050s 2 degrees rise in Global Mean Temperature (GMT) (from the 1961-90 baseline as used in the latest UK climate change projections (UKCP09); 2050s 4 degrees rise in GMT assuming a continuation in current levels of adaptation and high population growth. Social flood risk is given as two different measures for each neighbourhood: Neighbourhood scale - a 'group' measure which incorporates the chance of flooding occurring in the floodplain (accounting for defences), the number of people living within the floodplain and the overall social vulnerability of the neighbourhood. High positive scores identify neighbourhoods where large numbers of the most vulnerable people are exposed to flooding. Individual scale - an 'average' measure which incorporates the chance of flooding occurring in the floodplain (accounting for defences) and the overall social vulnerability of the neighbourhood. The measure generates a 'per person' risk estimate. It helps to identify neighbourhoods where the vulnerability of those exposed is high (even when in reality only a few people may be exposed). It is calculated by dividing the SFRI group measure by the floodplain population.",

The level of social flood risk (SFRI) at a neighbourhood scale is a measure of geographic flood disadvantage (i.e. where social vulnerability and exposure to flooding coincide). The Social Flood Risk Index (SFRI) is a relative index and has no defined units. The greater the value for a neighbourhood, the higher the level of social flood risk.High levels of risk occur where high numbers of people live in the floodplain in a neighbourhood with high social vulnerability. High negative values are a result of high numbers of people living in the floodplain in a neighbourhood with low social vulnerability. Neighbourhoods where no-one lives in the floodplain have a value of zero. Social flood risk maps are provided for two flood themes: pluvial (surface water) flooding coastal and fluvial flooding combined Social flood risk maps cover three different scenarios: Present day; 2050s 2 degrees rise in Global Mean Temperature (GMT) (from the 1961-90 baseline as used in the latest UK climate change projections (UKCP09); 2050s 4 degrees rise in GMT assuming a continuation in current levels of adaptation and high population growth. Social flood risk is given as two different measures for each neighbourhood: Neighbourhood scale - a 'group' measure which incorporates the chance of flooding occurring in the floodplain (accounting for defences), the number of people living within the floodplain and the overall social vulnerability of the neighbourhood. High positive scores identify neighbourhoods where large numbers of the most vulnerable people are exposed to flooding. Individual scale - an 'average' measure which incorporates the chance of flooding occurring in the floodplain (accounting for defences) and the overall social vulnerability of the neighbourhood. The measure generates a 'per person' risk estimate. It helps to identify neighbourhoods where the vulnerability of those exposed is high (even when in reality only a few people may be exposed). It is calculated by dividing the SFRI group measure by the floodplain population.",
